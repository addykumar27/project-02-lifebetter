          <p> I am a front-end web developer passionate about fashion, design, art, data representation, and the public good. I am constantly evaluating
            design, usability, and efficiencies in everything that I see and touch. I thrive in fast-paced and challenging environments. Currently,
            I am searching for junior web developer opportunities in e-commerce, retail, and/or creative industries.</p>

          <p>Currently I’m studying Full Stack Web Design. Previously I managed databases in MS Access and Excel as a contractor - at Visa and Wells Fargo Bank. Afterwards I built faith-based teams in Russia, refining skills in leadership and agility.  For a creative break I volunteered for two years producing 10 minute comedies, including two of my own.   Now I am focused on learning Ajax to React, Rails and Rspec, to work with teams making people's’ workflow easier.
            I hold a degree in History from UC Santa Barbara. Trying to understand ancient politics from limited clues was a great start in creating new jQuery and Ruby tools to make objects perform in new and useful ways.</p>
